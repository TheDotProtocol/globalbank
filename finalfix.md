# Global Dot Bank - Final Fix Summary

## 📅 Date: July 21, 2025

## 🎯 **Issues Resolved Today**

### 1. **Fixed Deposit Certificate API (500 Error)**
- **Problem**: Certificate generation was returning 500 Internal Server Error with "Unexpected end of JSON input"
- **Root Cause**: API was trying to access non-existent address fields (`address`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `postalCode`) from the User model in Prisma schema
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all address fields from user select statement in `/api/fixed-deposits/[id]/certificate/route.ts`
  - Added comprehensive error logging with emojis for debugging
  - Added input validation for fixed deposit ID
  - Fixed TypeScript error with proper error parameter typing (`error: any`)
  - Hardcoded `customerAddress: "Address not provided"` since address fields don't exist in schema

### 2. **Sidebar Consistency Across All Pages**
- **Problem**: Fixed Deposits tab was missing from some pages, inconsistent navigation
- **Solution**:
  - Created shared `Sidebar.tsx` component in `/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
  - Updated dashboard and transactions pages to use shared component
  - Added Fixed Deposits tab to all sidebars with proper active state highlighting
  - Ensured consistent navigation across all profile pages

### 3. **Enhanced Export Formats**
- **Transaction History**: Professional PDF with header, title, table, summary, and footer
- **Bank Statements**: Professional format with all required sections
- **FD Certificates**: Beautiful portrait mode with international banking standards

## 🚀 **Current Status**
