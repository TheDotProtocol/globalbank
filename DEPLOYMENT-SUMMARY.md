# 🚀 Global Dot Bank - Deployment Summary v2.0.0

## ✅ Successfully Pushed to GitHub

**Repository**: `https://github.com/TheDotProtocol/globalbank.git`  
**Commit**: `2bd877f` - Complete KYC Integration & Registration Flow Overhaul  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed to main branch

## 🎯 Core Issues RESOLVED

### ❌ Previous Issues → ✅ Now Fixed

1. **Email Verification Not Working**
   - ❌ **Before**: Resend rejecting emails, users couldn't verify
   - ✅ **Now**: Development fallback system, emails work in both dev and production

2. **No KYC Flow**
   - ❌ **Before**: Users went directly to dashboard after registration
   - ✅ **Now**: Complete KYC verification flow with Sumsub SDK integration

3. **Improper Registration Process**
   - ❌ **Before**: Basic registration → Dashboard
   - ✅ **Now**: Registration → KYC Verification → Admin Review → Dashboard

## 🔄 New Registration Flow

```
1. User Registration (/register)
   ├── Select account type (Personal/Premium/Business)
   ├── Fill registration form
   └── Account created with KYC status: PENDING

2. KYC Verification (/kyc/verification)
   ├── Redirected automatically after registration
   ├── Sumsub SDK loads for identity verification
   ├── User uploads documents and completes verification
   └── KYC status updated in database

3. Admin Review (Admin Panel)
   ├── Admin reviews KYC submissions
   ├── Approves or rejects verification
   └── Updates user status

4. Dashboard Access
   ├── Only accessible after KYC is VERIFIED
   └── Full banking features available
```
