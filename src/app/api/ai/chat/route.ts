**Savings Account Earnings:**
‚Ä¢ **$1,000 balance** at 5.5% = **$55/year** ($4.58/month)
‚Ä¢ **$5,000 balance** at 6.0% = **$300/year** ($25/month)
‚Ä¢ **$10,000 balance** at 6.0% = **$600/year** ($50/month)

**Fixed Deposit Earnings:**
‚Ä¢ **$1,000 for 12 months** at 9.0% = **$90 interest**
‚Ä¢ **$5,000 for 24 months** at 10.0% = **$1,000 interest**
‚Ä¢ **$2,000 for 6 months** at 7.5% = **$75 interest**

**Quick Calculation Formula:**
\`\`\`
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Example: $1,000 * 9% * 1 year = $90
\`\`\`

**Pro Tips for Maximizing Returns:**
1. **Use Fixed Deposits** for money you won't need soon
2. **Maintain higher balances** to reach premium savings tiers
3. **Consider longer terms** for higher fixed deposit rates
4. **Compound interest** works in your favor over time

**Comparison Example:**
‚Ä¢ $5,000 in savings (6.0%): $300/year
‚Ä¢ $5,000 in fixed deposit (10.0%): $500/year
‚Ä¢ **Difference: $200 more with fixed deposit!**
